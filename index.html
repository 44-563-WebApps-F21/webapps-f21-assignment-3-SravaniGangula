            "Fibonacci Sequence" redirects here. For the chamber ensemble, see Fibonacci Sequence (ensemble).
            A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21.
            In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
            such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1
