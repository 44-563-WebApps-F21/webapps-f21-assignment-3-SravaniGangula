            If Superman is the epitome of male superheroes, Wonder Woman is the epitome of female superheroes.
             Wonder Woman is one of the Big Three DC superheroes. She paved the way for female superheroes of all kinds,
              fought off the stereotypes of women in comics, and cemented herself as the greatest female superhero ever.
